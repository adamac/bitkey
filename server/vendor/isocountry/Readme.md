# isocountry-rs 

Provides an enumeration, `CountryCode`, of all [ISO 3166-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1)-defined countries.

Each `CountryCode` can be converted to and from its `alpha-2` and `alpha-3` representations, as well
as its numeric code. Further, the English names of each `CountryCode`, as defined by ISO 3166-1, can
also be obtained.

`isocountry-rs` follows the `stable` release of Rust.
