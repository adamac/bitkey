# Bitkey Terraform

All of Bitkey infrastructure is managed using [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/intro), or more
specifically, a wrapper on top of Terraform called [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/) that defines a more
opinionated way for using Terraform.

Documentation for how to use this repository is available at https://docs.wallet.build/runbooks/terraform/overview. Or if the site is down, see [source](https://github.com/squareup/wallet/tree/main/docs/docs/runbooks/terraform)
